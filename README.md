IMDb(Internet Movie Database) is the world's most popular and authoritative online database for movie, TV and celebrity content.The database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay.

IMDb_5000 is a dataset with 5000 rows of movie information including features such as facebook likes of the cast, gross, budget, critic reviews and so on.

In this challenge,the classification model is expected to predict if the movie is "hit/average/flop" based on selected attribues.
